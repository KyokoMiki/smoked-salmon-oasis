# üêü smoked-salmon  

A simple tool to take the work out of uploading on Gazelle-based trackers. It generates spectrals, gathers metadata, allows re-tagging/renaming files, and automates the upload process.

## üåü Features  

- **Interactive Uploading** ‚Äì Supports **multiple trackers** (RED / OPS).
- **Upconvert Detection** ‚Äì Checks 24-bit flac files for potential upconverts.
- **MQA Detection** ‚Äì Checks files for common MQA markers.
- **Duplicate Upload Detection** ‚Äì Prevents redundant uploads.  
- **Spectral Analysis** ‚Äì Generates, compresses, and verifies spectrals, exposed via a web interface.  
- **Spectral Upload** ‚Äì Can generate spectrals for an existing upload (based on local files), and update the release description.  
- **Lossy Master Report Generation** ‚Äì Supports lossy master reports during upload.
- **Metadata Retrieval** ‚Äì Fetches metadata from:
  - Bandcamp, Beatport, Deezer, Discogs, iTunes, JunoDownload, MusicBrainz, Qobuz, Tidal.
- **File Management** ‚Äì  
  - Retags and renames files to standard formats (based on metadata).
  - Checks file integrity and sanitizes if needed.  
- **Request Filling** ‚Äì Scans for matching requests on trackers.
- **Description generation** ‚Äì Edition description generation (tracklist, sources, available streaming platforms, encoding details...).
- **Down-convert and Transcode** ‚Äì Can downconvert 24-bit flac files to 16-bit, and transcode to mp3.
- **Update Notifications** ‚Äì Informs users when a new version is available.

## üì• Installation  

Manual installation instructions can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/wiki/Installation).

### üîπ  Install smoked-salmon 
These steps use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for installing the *smoked-salmon* package. [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) also works.
Installing with pip is not recommended because uv (and pipx) manage python versions and isolate the *smoked-salmon* installation from the system python installation.

#### Linux
1. Install system packages:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install sox flac ffmpeg mp3val curl unzip lame
    ```

2. Install uv:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

3. Install smoked-salmon package from github:
	```bash
	uv tool install git+https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon
	```

#### Windows
1. Install required system packages using winget:
    ```powershell
    winget install -e Gyan.FFmpeg ChrisBagwell.SoX Xiph.FLAC LAME.LAME ring0.MP3val.WF
    ```

2. Install uv:
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

3. Install smoked-salmon package from github:
	```powershell
	uv tool install git+https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon
	```

#### macOS
1. Install Homebrew (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2. Install system packages using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install sox flac ffmpeg mp3val curl unzip lame
    ```

3. Install uv:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

4. Install smoked-salmon package from github:
	```bash
	uv tool install git+https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon
	```

### üîπ  Initial Setup
1. Run salmon for the first time and follow the instructions to create a default configuration:
	```
	salmon-user@salmon:~$ salmon
	Could not find configuration path at /home/salmon-user/.config/smoked-salmon/config.toml.
	Do you want smoked-salmon to create a default config file at /home/salmon-user/.config/smoked-salmon/config.default.toml? [y/N]:
	```

2. Copy the default config to `~/.config/smoked-salmon/config.toml`.
	```
	cp ~/.config/smoked-salmon/config.default.toml ~/.config/smoked-salmon/config.toml
	```

3. Edit the `config.toml` file with your preferred text editor to add your API keys, session cookies and update your preferences (see the [Configuration Wiki](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/wiki/Configuration)).

4. Use the `checkconf` command to verify that the connection to the trackers is working:

	```
	salmon checkconf
	```

5. Use the `health` command to verify that all necesasary command line dependencies are installed:

	```
	salmon health
	```

### üê≥ Docker Installation
A Docker image is generated per release.
**Disclaimer**: I am not actively using the docker image myself, feedback is appreciated regarding that guide.

1. Pull the latest image:
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon:latest
    ```

2. Copy the content of the file [`config.toml`](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/blob/master/data/config.default.toml) to a location on your host server. Alternatively, run smoked-salmon and let it generate a `config.default.toml`.

3. Edit the `config.toml` file with your preferred text editor to add your API keys, session cookies and update your preferences (see the [Configuration Wiki](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/wiki/Configuration)).

4. Run the container with the `checkconf` command to verify that the connection to the trackers is working:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it  --network=host \
    -v /path/to/your/music:/data \
    -v /path/to/your/config/directory:/root/.config/smoked-salmon/ \
    -v /path/to/your/smoked.db/directory:/root/.local/share/smoked-salmon/ \
    -v /path/to/your/generated/dottorrents:/app/.torrents
    ghcr.io/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon:latest checkconf
    ```

Depending on how you've set the `DOTTORRENTS_DIR` in your `config.toml`, you may need to add an additional volume to your Docker command to map the directory where `.torrent` files will be saved on the host system.

## üöÄ Usage

### üé® Terminal Colors
smoked-salmon uses distinct terminal colors for different types of messages:

* Default ‚Äì General information
* Red ‚Äì Errors or critical failures
* Green ‚Äì Success messages
* Yellow ‚Äì Information headers
* Cyan ‚Äì Section headers
* Magenta ‚Äì User prompts

### üîß CLI Mode
smoked-salmon runs in CLI mode, except for spectral visualization, which launches a web server. Quick start usage instructions can be found on the [Wiki Usage page](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/wiki#usage).

The examples below show how to run smoked-salmon directly. If you're using Docker, you'll need to adjust them accordingly, but the underlying principles remain the same.

On the first run, you will need to create the database:
```bash
salmon migrate
```

To see the available commands, just type:
```bash
salmon
```

To test the connection to the trackers, run:
```bash
salmon checkconf
```

To check the status of salmon's command line and config dependencies, run:
```bash
salmon health
```

To start an upload (with the WEB source):
```bash
salmon up /data/path/to/album -s WEB
```

You can get help directly from the CLI by appending --help to any command. This is especially useful for the up command which has a lot of possible options.

### üåê Spectral Web Interface
Spectrals are viewable via a built-in web server. By default, access it at: http://localhost:55110/spectrals

## üîÑ Updating

For **normal installs**:
```bash
uv tool update salmon
```

For **manual installs**:
```bash
cd smoked-salmon
git pull
uv sync
```

For **Docker users**:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon:latest
```
